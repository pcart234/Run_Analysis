# Run_Analysis
To run analysis of datasets.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The datasets are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The large datasets are to be merged, and then separate the "mean" and "sd" variables. 
The final step is to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Then, save the final tidy data file as a .txt using write.table, which is called "test2.txt".
