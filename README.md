# Run_Analysis
To run analysis of datasets.
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The datasets are data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The large datasets are to be merged, and then take the "mean" and "sd".
